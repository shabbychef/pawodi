preschool. We heard horrible tales from other parents as it made the rounds
(the worst was the kid who puked on another family at &lt;em&gt;the Nutcracker&lt;/em&gt;).
Baby mama and I were just a bit too smug about having avoided this plague. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as they say, whom Santa notices, he destroys. On Christmas night, an hour
or so after the children went to sleep, we heard a kind of coughing from their
room, and then a comically loud water spilling type sound. And so it began. I
was the only one to escape without actually vomiting (let us say I had other 
severe gastric consequences, and leave it at that), as the virus picked us off
one by one. Things were especially tricky with Jiro, who was 15 months old at
the time, and would give no real warning before puking: just walking along,
then spits out a bunch of water, takes no real notice, toddles along through
the vomit puddle, &lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt; Cleaning up after a puking child while you are 
seriously nauseous is, I can attest, horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of viral telephone did not stop with the immediate family. My
father-in-law, in town for the holidays, took ill some
three days later, spending the whole night puking. The rest of us left the
apartment so he could get some sleep. It was a bit cold, and we were too
fragile to do much outdoors. So it was that we found ourselves at
Ikea. Imagine a family of dehydrated zombies wandering endlessly
through Ikea, with no visible purpose other than killing time. OK, I guess
that describes most people at Ikea, but in our case we were also contagious.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="horror"></category><category term="sickness"></category></entry></feed>
