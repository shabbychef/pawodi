Younger brother Jiro, just over two, idolizes O, and volunteered he
would be a purple Tarantula. I obliged with the costumes. As is par
for the course, wandering around exercising candy arbitrage is hard
work. At one point, young Jiro scampered to a (thankfully vacant)
house stoop, and told me, "This is a fuckingshit, daddy! A fuckingshit!"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="shame"></category><category term="cursing"></category><category term="rascals"></category></entry><entry><title>Kitler youth</title><link href="http://parenting-without-dignity.com/kitler-youth.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-15T21:01:04-07:00</updated><author><name>Steven</name></author><id>tag:parenting-without-dignity.com,2014-10-15:kitler-youth.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I only feel comfortable posting this one because I am technically Jewish.
'Technically' because, under Jewish law, since my mother was raised with
two sets of dishes, I am one of the Chosen People, ignoring that I grew
up eating Cheerios on Passover, and thinking Hannukah was the most important
holiday. Some months ago we spent a morning with friends of the family
who are functional Jews. The father is also a bicycle enthusiast, as am I.
I decided to draw our four year old into a discussion of our cargo bike,
which was my midlife crisis Porsche substitute, with the other dad. 
Admittedly this was a bit of a boast, but that is the purpose of a midlife
crisis toy. I was to be upstaged, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As might be familiar to 
parents of toddlers, the child wanted no part of our conversation. Instead,
he started riffing on what I was saying, going off on tangents, and then
spouting nonsensical rhymes, which quickly devolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Me:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Otaro, do you like bikes?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Otaro:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy faddy kaddy kaddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Me:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Does that mean you like cargo bikes?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Otaro:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Kikes.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Me:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nervously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;No, _bikes_.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Otaro:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sensing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blood&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Kikes. Kikes! Kikes! Kikes!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do not remember how I distracted the child from his stream of 
racial epithets, maybe I shoved some apple slices in his mouth.
I do distinctly remember that feeling of wanting the earth to open
up and swallow me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="shame"></category><category term="cursing"></category></entry></feed>
