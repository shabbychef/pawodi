'Technically' because, under Jewish law, since my mother was raised with
two sets of dishes, I am one of the Chosen People, ignoring that I grew
up eating Cheerios on Passover, and thinking Hannukah was the most important
holiday. Some months ago we spent a morning with friends of the family
who are functional Jews. The father is also a bicycle enthusiast, as am I.
I decided to draw our four year old into a discussion of our cargo bike,
which was my midlife crisis Porsche substitute, with the other dad. 
Admittedly this was a bit of a boast, but that is the purpose of a midlife
crisis toy. I was to be upstaged, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As might be familiar to 
parents of toddlers, the child wanted no part of our conversation. Instead,
he started riffing on what I was saying, going off on tangents, and then
spouting nonsensical rhymes, which quickly devolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Me:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Oskar, do you like bikes?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Oskar:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy faddy kaddy kaddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Me:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Does that mean you like cargo bikes?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Oskar:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Kikes.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nervously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;No, _bikes_.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Oskar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sensing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blood&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Kikes. Kikes! Kikes! Kikes!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do not remember how I distracted the child from his stream of 
racial epithets, maybe I shoved some apple slices in his mouth.
I do distinctly remember that feeling of wanting the earth to open
up and swallow me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="shame"></category><category term="cursing"></category></entry></feed>
