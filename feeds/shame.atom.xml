Younger brother Jiro, just over two, idolizes O, and volunteered he
would be a purple Tarantula. I obliged with the costumes. As is par
for the course, wandering around exercising candy arbitrage is hard
work, and the kids started to squawk. 
At one point, young Jiro scampered to a (thankfully vacant)
house stoop, and told me, "This is a fuckingshit, daddy! A fuckingshit!"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="shame"></category><category term="cursing"></category><category term="rascals"></category></entry><entry><title>Kitler youth</title><link href="http://parenting-without-dignity.com/kitler-youth.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-15T21:01:04-07:00</updated><author><name>Steven</name></author><id>tag:parenting-without-dignity.com,2014-10-15:kitler-youth.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I only feel comfortable posting this one because I am technically Jewish.
'Technically' because, under Jewish law, since my mother was raised with
two sets of dishes, I am one of the Chosen People, ignoring that I grew
up eating Cheerios on Passover, and thinking Hannukah was the most important
holiday. Some months ago we spent a morning with friends of the family
who are functional Jews. The father is also a bicycle enthusiast, as am I.
I decided to draw our four year old into a discussion of our cargo bike,
which was my midlife crisis Porsche substitute, with the other dad. 
Admittedly this was a bit of a boast, but that is the purpose of a midlife
crisis toy. I was to be upstaged, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As might be familiar to 
parents of toddlers, the child wanted no part of our conversation. Instead,
he started riffing on what I was saying, going off on tangents, and then
spouting nonsensical rhymes, which quickly devolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Otaro, do you like bikes?&amp;quot;
Otaro: &amp;quot;Daddy faddy kaddy kaddy.&amp;quot;
Me: &amp;quot;Does that mean you like cargo bikes?&amp;quot;
Otaro: &amp;quot;Kikes.&amp;quot;
Me: (nervously) &amp;quot;No, _bikes_.&amp;quot;
Otaro: (sensing blood in the water) &amp;quot;Kikes. Kikes! Kikes! Kikes!&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do not remember how I distracted the child from his stream of 
racial epithets, maybe I shoved some apple slices in his mouth.
I do distinctly remember that feeling of wanting the earth to open
up and swallow me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="shame"></category><category term="cursing"></category></entry></feed>
