Summary: From the mouthes of babes, this.
Author: Steven

Our youngest turns three next month, which seems about right because he
has this whole 'two year old' thing nailed. We've spent many an eternity
at the grocery store, or out on the sidewalk, or the library with 'Jiro'
sprawled out, face-down, pounding his little fists on the ground and
screaming. He has turned tantruming into a high art. Recently he had
occasion to complain upon awakening from a nap, one of his
extra special favorite times to go utterly nuts. This time, from his mouth 
came an unintentional, perfectly-formed Zen KÃ´an: "I want to wake
up without waking up."

I want to write that it resulted in one of those Zen storybook moments of
me achieving perfect enlightenment. The truth is, however, that you can't 
reach enlightenment with all the whining and crying in this house.
