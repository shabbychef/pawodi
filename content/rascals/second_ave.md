Summary: Kiddo curses like a sailor.
Author: Steven

We took the kiddos to New York City for a few days. As a wise dad once
said, "vacation is another word for your kids not sleeping in new places."
While on the subway train, riding uptown, the conductor's voice boomed
out, "next stop, second avenue." Our youngest, almost three, replied, 
"next stop, fucking avenue!"
