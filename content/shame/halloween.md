Summary: Child the younger lets us know what he's thinking.

For Halloween this year, Otaro, our oldest, wanted to be a Tarantula. 
Younger brother Jiro, just over two, idolizes O, and volunteered he
would be a purple Tarantula. I obliged with the costumes. As is par
for the course, wandering around exercising candy arbitrage is hard
work. At one point, young Jiro scampered to a (thankfully vacant)
house stoop, and told me, "This is a fuckingshit, daddy! A fuckingshit!"
