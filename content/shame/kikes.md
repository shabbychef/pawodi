Summary: Rhymes are unfun
Author: Steven

I only feel comfortable posting this one because I am technically Jewish.
'Technically' because, under Jewish law, since my mother was raised with
two sets of dishes, I am one of the Chosen People, ignoring that I grew
up eating Cheerios on Passover, and thinking Hannukah was the most important
holiday. Some months ago we spent a morning with friends of the family
who are functional Jews. The father is also a bicycle enthusiast, as am I.
I decided to draw our four year old into a discussion of our cargo bike,
which was my midlife crisis Porsche substitute, with the other dad. 
Admittedly this was a bit of a boast, but that is the purpose of a midlife
crisis toy. I was to be upstaged, however.

As might be familiar to 
parents of toddlers, the child wanted no part of our conversation. Instead,
he started riffing on what I was saying, going off on tangents, and then
spouting nonsensical rhymes, which quickly devolved:

	Me: "Oskar, do you like bikes?"
	Oskar: "Daddy faddy kaddy kaddy."
	Me: "Does that mean you like cargo bikes?"
	Oskar: "Kikes."
	Me (nervously): "No, _bikes_."
	Oskar (sensing blood in the water): "Kikes. Kikes! Kikes! Kikes!"

I do not remember how I distracted the child from his stream of 
racial epithets, maybe I shoved some apple slices in his mouth.
I do distinctly remember that feeling of wanting the earth to open
up and swallow me.
