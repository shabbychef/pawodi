Summary: Happy Birthday!
Author: Steven

We recently celebrated Otaro's birthday with a party for his new classmates.
As is the custom at this age, we asked that guests _not_ bring gifts, as our
house is already blessed with crap everywhere.  Not everyone gets the message,
however, and a few slip in the door.  This is expected.  Included, however,
with the odd assortment of art supplies and what-not, was a small bag in which
was wrapped ... a half-empty box of birthday candles! Surprise! 

If you are like us--slacker parents--you might have a part of your junk closet
filled with bags of gifts bought in bulk, or received and to be regifted,
or doubly-ordered questionable books from Amazon. In that closet, you might have
your wrapping paper and maybe your birthday candles, shoved between your
plastic jack-o-lanterns and Christmas stockings. Had some classmate's parents,
in a mad scramble for the 6th consecutive weekend birthday party just grabbed
the wrong bag from the closet? It just might have happened, and it just might
not have been me this time.
