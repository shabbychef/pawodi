Summary: How we spent last Christmas
Author: Steven

Leading up to last Christmas, there was a stomach flu going around Otaro's
preschool. We heard horrible tales from other parents as it made the rounds
(our daughter puked on another family at _the Nutcracker_; we weren't there,
but the nanny was horrified). Baby mama and I were just a bit too smug about
having avoided this plague. 

But, as they say, whom Santa notices, he destroys. On Christmas night, an hour
or so after the children went to sleep, we heard a kind of coughing from their
room, and then a comically loud water spilling type sound. And so it began. I
was the only one to escape without actually vomiting (let us say I had other 
severe gastric consequences, and leave it at that), as the virus picked us off
one by one. Things were especially tricky with Jiro, who was 15 months old at
the time, and would give no real warning before puking: just walking along,
then spits out a bunch of water, takes no real notice of it, walks in it,
_etc._ I can tell you from experience that ...
